    <ol>
        <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. 
            It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), 
            so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. 
            Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.
            Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</li>
        <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</li>
        <li>Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce</li>
        <li>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 375°F</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna</li>
        <li>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce). 
            Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. 
            Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.
